/**
 * This Spring controller demonstrates how WebFlux can be used to
 * handle HTTP GET requests via asynchronous reactive programming.
 * These GET requests are mapped to various methods that perform
 * operations on recursively-structured folders containing documents
 * and/or sub-folders.
 *
 * In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP
 * requests are handled by a controller that defines the
 * endpoints/routes for each supported operation, i.e.,
 * {@code @GetMapping}, {@code @PostMapping}, {@code @PutMapping} and
 * {@code @DeleteMapping}, which correspond to the HTTP GET, POST,
 * PUT, and DELETE calls, respectively.  These components are
 * identified by the @RestController annotation below.
 *
 * WebFlux uses the {@code @GetMapping} annotation to map HTTP GET
 * requests onto methods in the {@code FolderController}.  GET
 * requests invoked from any HTTP web client (e.g., a web browser)
 * or command-line utility (e.g., Curl or Postman).
