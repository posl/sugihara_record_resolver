/**
 * This Spring controller demonstrates how WebFlux can be used to

 * asynchronously.
 *
 * In Spring's approach to building RSocket services, message
 * requests are handled by a controller that defines the
 * endpoints/routes for each supported operation, i.e.,
 * {@code @MessageMapping}.  These components are
 * identified by the @Controller annotation below.
 *
 * WebFlux uses the {@code @MessageMapping} annotation to map RSocket
 * requests onto methods in the {@code ExchangeRateControllerRSocket}.
