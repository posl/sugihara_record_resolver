/**
 * This Spring controller demonstrates how WebFlux can be used to
 * handle HTTP POST requests via reactive programming.  These requests
 * are mapped to method(s) that convert between various currencies
 * asynchronously.
 *
 * In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP
 * requests are handled by a controller that defines the
 * endpoints/routes for each supported operation, i.e.,
 * {@code @GetMapping}, {@code @PostMapping}, {@code @PutMapping} and
 * {@code @DeleteMapping}, which correspond to the HTTP GET, POST,
 * PUT, and DELETE calls, respectively.  These components are
 * identified by the @RestController annotation below.
 *
 * WebFlux uses the {@code @PostMapping} annotation to map HTTP POST
 * requests onto methods in the {@code ExchangeRateControllerAsync}.
 * POST requests invoked from any HTTP web client (e.g., a web
 * browser) or command-line utility (e.g., Curl or Postman).
