 * The main() function demonstrates the difference between a Java user
 * thread and a daemon thread.  If it's launched with no command-line
 * parameters the main thread creates a user thread, which can outlive
 * the main thread (i.e., it continues to run even after the main
 * thread exits).  If it's launched with a command-line parameter then
 * it creates a daemon thread, which exits when the main thread exits.
